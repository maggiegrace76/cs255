The DriverPass project was about building a system for a client who ran a driving school. They wanted a system where students could schedule lessons, pick different packages, and instructors could add notes. The system also needed to be secure and easy for admins to manage.

I think I did a good job making sure the system matched what the client asked for. I kept the use cases and diagrams simple and easy to understand.

If I could change one part of my work, I would clean up my diagrams and add clearer labels. That would make the design easier for others to follow without extra explanation.

I focused a lot on what the users would need, like easy sign-ups and account updates. It’s really important to think about the user because if the system isn’t easy to use, it won’t be successful.

When designing software, I like to break down each piece step-by-step. In the future, I would use more user stories and planning charts to organize my ideas better before jumping into the diagrams.
